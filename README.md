Given a PostgreSQL database and the DDL statements to analyze, pglockanalyze
executes the statements (commit or rollback) against the database and reports
the locks they acquired.

It is meant to be used in CI and/or development environments. See
[pglockanalyze-action](https://github.com/agis/pglockanalyze-action) for
integration with GitHub Actions.

## Status

This software is experimental and under development.

## Rationale

Understanding the locks your migrations will acquire is crucial to avoiding
downtime in  production traffic. Tools like the [official Postgres
docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/explicit-locking.html) and
[strong_migrations](https://github.com/ankane/strong_migrations) are invaluable;
however, reasoning your way through complex DDL statements is not always
practical.

pglockanalyze is meant to complement, not replace such tools, by executing your
migrations against a test database (that you have to provision) and dynamically
identifying the locks acquired at runtime. It then prints a report of the locks
that were acquired.

By default, pglockanalyze rolls back the transactions it analyzes, so you can
safely run it against a test database without worrying about leaving it in and
inconsistent state. If you want to commit the transactions, you can use the
`--commit` option.

## Installation

You can install pglockanalyze using [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html):

```shell
$ cargo install pglockanalyze
```

We do not distribute binaries yet, but we may do so in the future.

## Usage

```shell
$ echo 'ALTER TABLE users ALTER COLUMN name SET NOT NULL' | pglockanalyze --db 'postgres://foo@bar'
ALTER TABLE users ALTER COLUMN name SET NOT NULL
	acquired `AccessExclusive` lock on relation `users` (oid=16386)
```

Use `--help` to see all options:

```shell
Usage: pglockanalyze [OPTIONS] --db <postgres connection string> [INPUT]

Arguments:
  [INPUT]  The DDL statements to analyze. If not provided or is -, read from standard input [default: -]

Options:
      --db <postgres connection string>
          The database to connect to
  -f, --format <FORMATTER>
          The output format of the analysis [default: plain] [possible values: plain, json]
      --distinct-transactions
          Execute each statement in its own transaction. By default all statements are executed in a single transaction. Implies --commit
      --commit
          Commit the transactions. By default they are rolled back
  -h, --help
          Print help
  -V, --version
          Print version
```
